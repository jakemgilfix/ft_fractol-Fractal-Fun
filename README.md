# Fract'ol : A 42 Silicon Valley Fractal Renderer

![screenshot](/screenshots/mandelbrot.png?raw=true)

A multi-threaded (4 threads) fractal renderer that supports six different (pre-defined) types of fractals.

This is the second project in the graphics branch of the old (pre-2020) curriculum at 42 Silicon Valley. It's built using the `minilibx` C library, which provides very basic graphics functions, like opening a window and drawing a pixel in that window. View the assignment [here](https://github.com/jakemgilfix/ft_fractol-Fractal-Fun/blob/master/fract_ol.en.pdf).

As with all 42 Silicon Valley projects, all code must comply with [42's style guide or 'Norme'](https://github.com/jakemgilfix/ft_fractol-Fractal-Fun/blob/master/norme.en.pdf). I would be remiss not to mention that this style guide is extremely dated and forces arbitrary constraints (e.g., 25 lines per function, 5 functions per file) that, however well-intended, often result in sub-optimal code.
